## AI Kenya
[AI Kenya]('https://kenya.ai/') is a community of AI practitioners & Data Scientist across East Africa that come together to share knowledge & challenges in the field. 
This is done thru' meetups, learning paths & an Annual conference.

In one of the many events, there is one called a **Show & Tell**where participants do exactly that, show and tell.

There is a Show & Tell happening this March 9th 2019 and I will be giging a talk about Autonomous Vehicles

This repo is basicaly for that

## Behavioral Clonning

The goals of this project shall be:

* Use the simulator to collect data of good driving behavior
* Design, train and validate a model that predicts a steering angle from image data
* Use the model to drive the vehicle autonomously around the first track in the simulator. The vehicle should remain on the road for an entire loop around the track.
* Summarize the results with a written report

In this project, I will use what i've learned about deep neural networks and convolutional neural networks to clone driving behavior. I will train, validate and test a 
model using Keras. The model will output a steering angle to an autonomous vehicle.

The cool guys over at Udacity  have provided a simulator where you can steer a car around a track for data collection. I'll use image data and steering angles to 
train a neural network and then use this model to drive the car autonomously around the track.
